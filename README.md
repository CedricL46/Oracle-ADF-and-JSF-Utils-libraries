# Oracle-ADF-and-JSF-Utils-libraries
General useful static utilities functions for Oracle ADF and JSF

Original library authors are : Duncan Mills, Steve Muench and Ric Smith.
They last updated those in 2007.

I've been working on clients Oracle ADF projects for the last 10 years, and the first mandatory steps are always the same : 
– Download the latest version of the Oracle ADF Demo project (FusionOrderDemo) 
– Search and copy the ADFUtils and JSFUtils java class
– Add them to your ViewController projet
 
Those libraries are so important, they should be added by Oracle to the core oracle ADF libraries.
Since they aren't, and we still have to manually add them to our project, I decided to set up this public repository to have them easily accessible to everyone. And so, without having to search the web for the Oracle ADF Demo project. 
Please remember, they were firstly open source by their original authors.

I've also added my own utilities functions over the years. 
If you think of some other function to improve those libraries, feel free to open a PR.
